# Expense-tracker-project

It is a program, design having in mind young people, with the main objective of showing them how easy is for them to over spend money. 
It is well documented, that people on an ideal scenario, should save 20% of their monthly income. This is specially easy forgotten by youngsters as they are used to pay by electronic methods only and purchase unnecesary items all the time.
In my program I ask the user to provide their monthly income, and then every day of the month (assuming a 31 day month) record daily total spend amount.
The program keeps adding daily expenses, and if the total expense amount reaches the 80% of the maximum monthly budget (80% of salary), alerts the person that they are reaching the threshold. So it helps them think twice before carrying on spending money at the same pace. Also to remember they have a desire to save money for the future (ideally) or for other projects.
If at the end of the month they have not spend all their maximum monthly expense budget, an alert message pops, congratulating them. 
If they have over spend, they will also get an alert inviting them to review their expenses to reflect if they could have spend less money with the aim of achieving their monthly saving target.
